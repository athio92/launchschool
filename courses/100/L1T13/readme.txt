Organizing Your Code on Github - 

We suggest that you organize your solutions this way:

-use 1 git repository for all exercises in the Ruby book (remember not to ever nest git repositories)
-create a folder within that repository for each chapter in the book
-create a separate file for every exercise in the chapter
